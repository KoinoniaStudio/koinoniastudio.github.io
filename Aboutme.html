          <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-24 text-xl leading-9 text-center text-gray-900">My name is Josephine Frenkel. I was born in the Netherlands in the 1950s. I now live in Pontlliw, on the outskirts of Swansea. I would like to share my “journey” with you.

            For me a significant year was 2016 when my photography and pictures were exhibited at Swansea’s Grand Theatre Arts Wing. Also, when I had a serious heart attack. Both my heart attack and my photography exhibits were reported in the local “Evening Post”. That year was also a turning point in my spiritual life.</p>

                <p class="max-w-md text-gray-900">During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic with everyone in and out of lockdowns, my youngest daughter collapsed and was rushed into intensive care. She had been living with a serious eating disorder for some time. I was told for two weeks that she wouldn’t pull through. However, after three months in hospital and despite the odds against her, and with Covid-19 around, she miraculously survived.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="max-w-md text-gray-900">With heightened stress and lockdowns, a new period of creativity began for me which was also therapeutic. I tried my first ever painting. I started experimenting with resin art and enjoyed painting more and more. I made sets of coasters, each original and unique, and was delighted how much they were appreciated.</p>

                <p class="max-w-md text-gray-900">My living room in my lovely, small cottage was the only space to do my art. In 2021 my Christian church family donated materials and free labour to make possible the building of a studio in my garden. The God of grace I had found in 2016 made the impossible become reality.</p>

                <p class="max-w-md text-gray-900">The same year my daughter number 2 was rushed into hospital and was in a coma. For three weeks I was told that she would not pull through. Because of the prayers of many, her miraculous recovery began. In a short time and to the utter amazement of the medics, she was eating, talking and in her own strength walked out of the hospital. During this period, I also had another heart procedure.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="max-w-md text-gray-900">I had been through an incredibly scary, heart-breaking, glorious and joyful time. Through all this my art studio provided a therapeutic haven and a place which gave me my sanity and creativity. I continued with my art. I enjoyed my gift of a studio, which was beyond my dreams and not only helped my creativity but helped me avoid falling into the pit of worry and despair.

                    I want to give back out of the riches I feel I have received. For 10 years I have walked a painful journey with my youngest daughter who has a serious eating disorder. I have discovered there is little awareness about eating disorders and the challenges faced in providing for the needs of sufferers, not only in Swansea but also in Wales as a whole. I want to use my art to help in some way.</p>

I know this needs big money and big hearts. The idea of “Have a Heart” was born out of this vision. KOINONIA STUDIO was the result of my personal vision and was registered as a social business in 2022. It is a “profit for purpose” company.</p>
